## June 7, 2026 - Midday Status Note

User asked:

> so, since morning, what have you done and accomplished?

Archived answer:

Honestly: not enough, and not the right final outcome for the visual cards.

What did get accomplished today:

1. AutoDL / ComfyUI is running and reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:6006`.
2. We picked and used the `vGPU-32GB` AutoDL instance.
3. You downloaded the Qwen/Nunchaku model successfully:
   `svdq-int4_r32-qwen-image-lightningv1.1-8steps.safetensors`
4. Backend Comfy foundation was added and committed:
   - `55de9d2 Add ComfyUI generation client`
   - `785555f Wire Comfy Qwen image workflow`
5. The backend now has a Comfy client, AutoDL URL support, workflow loading, and tests/build around that path.
6. I confirmed the current Comfy setup is Qwen/Nunchaku image generation, not Flux Kontext, not Qwen Image Edit, not dedicated virtual try-on.
7. I proved AutoDL has many video nodes installed, including Wan/VideoHelperSuite, but I did not produce a real proper per-function video workflow.
8. I made a bad generic "live video" pass, then reverted it:
   - bad commit: `602ea82`
   - revert commit: `8003074`
9. Frontend build currently passes after the revert.

What did not get accomplished:

1. The site cards are not finished to your standard.
2. The before/after product consistency problem is not properly solved.
3. The 3-second videos are not real AI videos. My pan/zoom/shaking approach was lame, and you were right to reject it.
4. I did not correctly respect that each card has its own functionality.
5. I wasted time trying to patch visuals instead of setting up the correct workflow per mode.

So the real status is: backend/AutoDL foundation moved forward, but the landing visuals/videos are still not solved.

## June 8, 2026 - Early Morning AutoDL/Qwen Edit Setup

Goal:

Get a real product-preserving Qwen/Nunchaku image-edit workflow working for
DomStudio Catalog/Product mode.

What went wrong:

1. The first AutoDL/tzwm setup partially downloaded model files, then repeatedly
   crashed in the initializer cleanup step:

```text
OSError: [Errno 39] Directory not empty: '/root/autodl-tmp/tzwm_qwen-image'
```

2. That same broken path later looked for missing files in the stale temp folder:

```text
/root/autodl-tmp/tzwm_qwen-image/qwen_2.5_vl_7b_fp8_scaled.safetensors
```

3. The first instance could see the VAE and some Nunchaku diffusion models, but
   `CLIPLoader` had an empty `clip_name` list. The missing file was:

```text
qwen_2.5_vl_7b_fp8_scaled.safetensors
```

4. Hugging Face timed out from AutoDL, and ModelScope started downloading extra
   files, including a large unnecessary diffusion model. That path was stopped.

Decision:

Stop fighting the broken initializer. Use a fresh AutoDL instance and verify
models through ComfyUI `/object_info` before doing any more workflow work.

What worked:

1. New AutoDL instance:

```text
autodl-container-95c4479bc9-7f1ffc79
```

2. ComfyUI reachable inside the instance:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:6006
```

3. `CLIPLoader` now sees:

```text
qwen_2.5_vl_7b_fp8_scaled.safetensors
qwen_3_4b.safetensors
```

4. `VAELoader` now sees:

```text
qwen_image_vae.safetensors
```

5. `NunchakuQwenImageDiTLoader` now sees:

```text
svdq-int4_r128-qwen-image-edit-2509-lightning-4steps-251115.safetensors
z_image_turbo_bf16.safetensors
```

6. Matching Qwen edit example workflows exist:

```text
/root/autodl-tmp/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-nunchaku/example_workflows/nunchaku-qwen-image-edit-2509-lightning.json
/root/autodl-tmp/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-nunchaku/example_workflows/nunchaku-qwen-image-edit-2509.json
/root/autodl-tmp/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-nunchaku/example_workflows/nunchaku-qwen-image-edit.json
/root/autodl-tmp/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-nunchaku/example_workflows/nunchaku-qwen-image.json
```

Local repo update made:

```text
domstudio-backend/workflows/product_image.json
```

was patched from the unavailable old model:

```text
svdq-int4_r32-qwen-image-lightningv1.1-8steps.safetensors
```

to the model visible on the new instance:

```text
svdq-int4_r128-qwen-image-edit-2509-lightning-4steps-251115.safetensors
```

Important limitation:

The local `product_image.json` is still a simple graph. It should not be treated
as the final product-preserving workflow. Tomorrow, load the Qwen image-edit
example manually in ComfyUI, test one uploaded product image, then export the
working graph in API format and wire that into DomStudio.
